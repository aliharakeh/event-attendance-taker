# App

This app is a mobile application for Android. it uses kotlin, jetpack compose, and room sqlite.

# Structure

## App Structure

-   data (data layer)
    -   entity (data model)
    -   dao (data access object)
    -   repository (data source)
-   navigation (app navigation)
-   screens (app screens and pages)
-   ui
    -   components (shared components to use in the app)
    -   theme
-   utils (utils functions)

## Structure Rules

-   do not add more than on composable component in the same file, use separate files
-   minimize the addition of new composable components, use existing components from the ui/components directory if possible

# UI

-   the ui should only use components from the ui/components directory
-   if there is not suitable component, create a new one in the ui/components directory
-   the created components should be reusable and generic with configurable parameters
-   each new component should be in a separate file
-   components can use other components from the ui/components directory to create more complex components

# Data Manipulation

-   data manipulation should not be done in the ui layer, it should be done in the data layer
-   create the necessary function in the data layer and then use them in the ui layer and screens
-   try to reuse the data layer functions in other parts of the app as much as possible
